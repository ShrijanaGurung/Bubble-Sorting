# Bubble-Sorting

This program combines two of the most useful Matlab tools (i.e plotting and movie) along with bubble sorting, a method I learned during my initial programming classes. I was able to generate a small movie clip with the plotting function for the bubble sorting algorithm. The movie shows how a certain elements gets moved during the sorting process. I included a random sample data and was able to generate a movie which shows how bubble sorting process.
